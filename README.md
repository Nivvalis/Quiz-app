# Python Quiz App

This project contains two versions of a multiple-choice quiz app written in Python:

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI) version** (`quiz.py`)  
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) version** using `tkinter` (`gui.py`)

Both versions use the same question data stored in `questions.json`.
